    <h1>2018-2019 About Time Design Documentation</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p><span>Documenters:</span></p>
<p><span>Matthew Kouzios,&nbsp;</span><span>Eduardo Aviles</span></p>
<h1 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Overview"><span>Overview=
</span></h1>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-ProjectSummary"><span>Pr=
oject Summary</span></h2>
<p><span>The About Time project exists to give students a way to view their=
 work progress, generate a visual report on student work progress for docum=
entation purposes, and to give instructors a way to view student progress. =
The project may eventually go to the plugin marketplace for global use, and=
 if so the student/instructor roles would just be condensed into a general =
user role.</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-DocumentPurpose"><span>D=
ocument Purpose</span></h2>
<p><span>The purpose of this document is to provide information about each =
part of the About Time project, specifically for usage if the project becom=
es repurposed for another website such as GitLabs. This document will cover=
 all components of the plugin, and detail what features/designs are require=
d for each component. It will also give suggestions on design decisions, bu=
t the final say goes to the product owner.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h1 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Homepage"><span>Homepage=
</span></h1>
<p><span>The homepage is focused on providing the user the ability to navig=
ate between features, learn about the project, and report issues found in t=
he project.</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Navigation"><span>Naviga=
tion</span></h2>
<p><span>The homepage allows users to go to their desired feature, with the=
 intention that each individual feature can be navigated to via the homepag=
e. This allows users to have a clear understanding of how to get to the fea=
ture they need, meaning they can go back to the homepage and find all the f=
eatures from there.</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Information"><span>Infor=
mation</span></h2>
<p><span>The homepage should also provide information about how to set up t=
he plugin as a shortcut, as well as information on the plugin and informati=
on on the team(s) working on it. The plugin shortcut setup tells the user h=
ow to add the About Time plugin to the website=E2=80=99s MSOE-specific navi=
gation bar; however, this may not be applicable to non-Jira websites. The t=
eam information section gives a brief overview of what features the project=
 offers, as well as a small explanation on why the project was created.</sp=
an></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-IssueReporting"><span>Is=
sue Reporting</span></h2>
<p><span>While issue reporting does not need to explicitly be on the homepa=
ge, it should be an easy-to-access feature that allows users to submit issu=
es they come across. The reporting should be directed to either the develop=
ment team or the product owner so that the issue can find its way into the =
proper hands to fix it. Any user may submit an issue; however, it may be pr=
udent to limit how many submissions may be made in a certain time period in=
 the event of a malicious user. </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Filtering"><span>Filteri=
ng</span></h2>
<p><span>In order to display project data, the project requires either a da=
te range or sprint for a given project. This is done through filtering, whe=
re the user selects a time period and a project and then gets the project d=
ata. Due to there being multiple features that use this information, the fi=
ltering feature can be placed on the homepage. However, not every feature w=
ill end up using the filtering information (see: Dashboard)&nbsp;</span><sp=
an>thus another solution may be prudent. When selecting a project, the drop=
 down should break into two sections: recent projects, and alphabetical. Th=
e topmost section is the recent projects section, where the most recently w=
orked on projects by the current user are displayed. The alphabetical secti=
on displays all projects, including those in the recent projects section, i=
n alphabetical order.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h1 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-TimeLogs"><span>Time Log=
s</span></h1>
<p><span>The time logs page is dedicated to displaying user=E2=80=99s work =
logs visually both through a time table and a work log table. These tables =
are included so that users can check their work progress for their desired =
time period in a way that is condensed but visually appealing. </span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-TimeTable"><span>Time Ta=
ble</span></h2>
<p><span>The time logs page will have a time table to reflect the team's ho=
urs logged along with work logs for the day. As shown in Figure 1 below, th=
e time table must have the team members listed, the daily hours logged for =
each user in the project, the summed daily hours for all users in the proje=
ct, the summed daily hours for all users in the project, and the summed wee=
kly hours for all users in the project.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Figure 1: The current time table implementation</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Each day in the table is also clickable to show that days work des=
cription along with unusual logging if there was any, see Figure 2 below fo=
r an example. The days with unusual logging have their logged hours in red.=
 The application should detect these issues in the users time logs, and spe=
cify them as unusual logs. In addition, the logging should specify what ent=
ries in the worklogs table are causing the issues. The issues the applicati=
on should check are when:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>4 or more hours are logged in a row by the same user</span></li>
<li><span>10 or more hours are logged in a day (including across multiple p=
rojects)</span></li>
<li><span>A work log description is missing</span></li>
<li><span>Logged times are overlapping</span></li>
<li><span>Time was logged to a story at a time before the story was created=
 (usually done by doing an action, creating a story for it, then logging ti=
me for the action done earlier in the day)</span></li>
<li><span>Time was logged two or more weeks after the work was done</span><=
/li>
</ul>
<p><span>An example of the worklogs popup is shown below, in Figure 2.</spa=
n></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Figure 2: This is an example of the work description after a day i=
s clicked</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Descriptions"><span>Desc=
riptions</span></h2>
<p><span>The time logs page should also include the work descriptions from =
the specified time period for the entire team. It should include the status=
, time spent, and the work description. This can be ordered from the most r=
ecent to least recent or whichever other way is seen fit. An example is pro=
vided in Figure 3 below. However, a different design can be implemented to =
reflect the product owner=E2=80=99s criteria.</span></p>
<p><span>Figure 3: This is an example of the descriptions portion for the t=
ime log page</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Emojis"><span>Emojis</sp=
an></h2>
<p><u><strong>FOR INDIVIDUAL USERS:</strong></u></p>
<p><span>The emojis can be found in the&nbsp;"<em>custom.pug</em>" file. Le=
t's say x =3D the user's/team member's actual hours that they've logged. Th=
e way it's currently set up is that if x &lt; 50% of their expected hours, =
it will print&nbsp;</span><span style=3D"color: rgb(206,145,120);">=F0=9F=
=98=94</span>. If 50%&lt;=3D x &lt; 70% of their expected&nbsp;hours, it wi=
ll print&nbsp;<span style=3D"color: rgb(206,145,120);">=F0=9F=98=90</span>.=
 If 70%&lt;=3D x &lt; 100% of their expected&nbsp;hours, it will print&nbsp=
;<span style=3D"color: rgb(206,145,120);">=F0=9F=98=80</span>. If x &gt;=3D=
 100%, it will print&nbsp;<span style=3D"color: rgb(206,145,120);">=F0=9F=
=92=AF</span>. If you reference the emoji key on the Time Table page ("View=
 Logs" button), you'll see the time log constraints.</p>
<p><span>These emojis and their time constraints can be found around line 3=
24 of the "<em>custom.pug</em>" file. The emoji that's selected is selected=
 via the use of simple if statements. You can just go in and alter these if=
 statements to either change the time constraints and/or the emojis that ar=
e displayed. Also, the emojis stand out seeing that they're surrounded by t=
ext, so locating them should be easy. There are also emojis (the same ones)=
 at the bottom of the "<em>custom.pug</em>" file, but that's for the whole =
team as opposed to the individual team-members. The next section will cover=
 emojis for the whole team.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><u><strong>FOR THE WHOLE TEAM:</strong></u></p>
<p><span>These emojis are also in the "custom.pug" file, but they're down t=
owards the bottom of the file. You can find the logic for this around line =
452 where you'll see a line of code that says "tr(class=3D"healthrow")" whe=
re tr stands for table row. Basically,&nbsp;it creates the row that will di=
splay the overall team's health. The logic underneath it handles the time l=
og constraints and the emojis that are used. This is pretty much the exact =
same as the individual&nbsp;user - reference the emoji key on the Time Tabl=
e page ("View Logs" button) to see the time time log constraints for the ov=
erall team. These time log constraints and the specific emojis that are dis=
played&nbsp;can be changed here just like you did above for the individual =
team members; you can just alter the if statements and the emojis to suit y=
our needs.</span></p>
<h1 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-StatusReportGeneration">=
<span>Status Report Generation</span></h1>
<p><span>The Status Report Generator is a feature that allows teams to view=
 a summary of a chosen date range or sprint for a given project. If the tea=
m has a documentation page, they should be able to publish it there as well=
. The report should at least include the team=E2=80=99s sprint goal, burndo=
wn, and individual contributions.</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Heading"><span>Heading</=
span></h2>
<p><span>The heading of the sprint report should include the specified spri=
nt along with the dates that are being covered in the report. The heading s=
hould also include the sprint goal and burndown chart/table. The burndown c=
hart/table should have a reflection of each individual members hours. The b=
urndown chart was attempted by one of the previous teams but was abandoned.=
 It isn=E2=80=99t pertinent but would be useful to have.</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Body"><span>Body</span><=
/h2>
<p><span>The body of the status report should be filled with the work logs =
of each individual team member. The work logs should be separated into stor=
ies, bugs/defects, internal improvements, or overheads. The work logs shoul=
d be further categorized into specific stories with their respective status=
, and then followed with the subtasks and their respective status. The subt=
asks are then followed by the time spent, the work description of the indiv=
idual, and any further comments for the individual. An example is provided =
below in Figure 4.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Figure 4: Example of the status report generator body feature</spa=
n></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Editing"><span>Editing</=
span></h2>
<p><span>Some members of a team may finish their work before others and wis=
h to make statements about their work logs. However, if they do so and then=
 publish the report, the work logs of other members of their teams may not =
be accurate. Therefore there should be a way for a user to add comments to =
their status report and save those comments without needing to generate the=
 status report.</span></p>
<h1 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Dashboard"><span>Dashboa=
rd</span></h1>
<p><span>The dashboard feature is dedicated to showing multiple projects in=
 one location, with time graphs and tables to present the project data in a=
 condensed manner. The page will be primarily used by professors or those i=
n a similar role as a way to quickly preview the work progress of multiple =
teams.</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-Filtering.1"><span>Filte=
ring</span></h2>
<p><span>As the dashboard is more of a standalone feature from the rest of =
the project, it should have the ability to filter projects and time periods=
 for display. At a minimum, it should be able to sort by current sprint or =
a custom date. It=E2=80=99s imperative to note that the current sprint may =
differ based on the project, so there should be validation to ensure each p=
roject displays the current sprint even if the dates for those sprints enco=
mpass different time periods. See Figure 5 below for an example.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>Figure 5: The time period navigation bar</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-ProjectsPortfolio"><span=
>Projects Portfolio</span></h2>
<p><span>The dashboard needs a way to allow a user to view multiple project=
s at a time as this feature is not introduced in the homepage. This can be =
done in any manner of ways, but the selected projects should be saved so th=
at that user does not need to re-select them if they intend to use the dash=
board feature in the future. In addition, the saved projects should be able=
 to be forgotten, in the event the user does not wish to see the worklogs f=
or that project anymore.</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-TimeGraph"><span>Time Gr=
aph</span></h2>
<p><span>This feature displays the times of the team over the specified tim=
e period as a line graph, allowing for a clean visual view for user time co=
mparisons. It is advised to allow users to select a position in the graph t=
o see the hours logged at the clicked location for user convenience. See Fi=
gure 6 below for an example time graph.</span></p>
<p><span>Figure 6: Time Graph over the period of November</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"id-2018-2019AboutTimeDesignDocumentation-TimeTable.1"><span>Time =
Table</span></h2>
<p><span>For each project being stored, the dashboard should display a time=
 table relating to that project and the time period selected. For more info=
rmation on the time table, see the Time Table&nbsp;</span><span>paragraph u=
nder the Time Logs&nbsp;</span><span>section.</span></p>
